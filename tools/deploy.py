"""Puts bin/IRC.D81 into net-tools on the MEGA65's SD card, keeping the IRC.CFG the
client wrote on the disk already there (the bookmarks: host, port, TLS,
nick, channels). Replacing the disk image outright loses them; mega-ftp,
ssh and mega-ntp each have one of these since one of them lost its
settings that way (mega-ntp REQUIREMENTS.md 5.3), and this client got
its own in the commit that created the file (REQUIREMENTS.md 5.18).

    python3 tools/deploy.py [--port /dev/cu.usbserial-23201] [image.d81]

Needs m65 and mega65_ftp from mega65-tools on the PATH (with or without
the .osx suffix) and c1541 from VICE. The machine is reset first, as
mega65_ftp needs; the card's disk is kept under build/deploy before it
is replaced, so a redeploy is undoable even if the carrying goes wrong.
